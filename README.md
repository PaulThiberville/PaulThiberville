# Hello, I'm Paul from France!

👋 Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub profile. Here's a bit about me:

- 💪 I’m currently working on [Budly]([https://www.budly.link/](https://www.budly.link/dl-app)), focusing primarily on the mobile application while also contributing to the web platform.
- ❤️ I work daily with **React**, **React Native**, and **Firebase** to bring projects to life.  
- ☁️ I also have basic knowledge of **Docker** and managing **Google Cloud Platform** clusters with **Kubernetes**.  
- 📫 Feel free to reach out by [email](mailto:paul.thiberville@gmail.com). I'd love to hear from you!  

Thanks for stopping by! 🚀
